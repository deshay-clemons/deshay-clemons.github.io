summary: Created a webpage for UH students and faculty to buy or sell their items.
---
For this project, I worked with a few group members to create a webpage to help benefit UH students. Our goal was to help students who dorm sell their excess items every semester. Usually at the beginning and end of the semester, students are either looking to buy or sell dormitory items such as miniture refridgerators, lamps, and office supplies. 

For our webpage called UH Manoa Marketplace, we created a site where students or even faculty are able to sell their items. Once loading the page, the user will be required to sign-up with their University of Hawai'i email. Once this is done the user can list items they would like to sell or query items they might be interested in. When putting an item up for sale, the user is then prompted to provide information about this item. For example, they must include the name, price, condition, image (as a URL), category, and description. If a user is interested in an item, they can like it so they can view it later within their favorites tab and email the owner for more information on where to meet. As an item receives more likes it appears on the Trending Page so users who are looking to sell can get an idea of what the popular items are. Each user has a profile page where they can update their status, view all of their favorites, and edit the information of the items they put up for sale. If the user's item was sold, they will have to remove it within their My Items page. For more information on the UH Manoa Marketplace, you can visit my groups organization page at: https://uh-manoa-marketplace.github.io/.

Throughout the experience of creating this page with my group members, I learned a lot about project management. As a group we collectively brainstormed certain features that we wanted for our site. Once we had a plentiful list, we would try to solve these issues and attempt to implement them on our website. In the project I worked extensively on the functionallity of the favorites feature that was implemented on the webpage. In addition, I worked on the search bar found in the Items for Sale page. In this page, I learned how sort items based on what the user types and by category at the same time. For example, if I wanted to buy an iPad I would go to the dropdown that says "All" and select "Electronics", then type our iPad to see if their are any users who are selling it. I truly enjoyed working together with my team and collaborating where everyone's ideas were openly viewed to achieve the final product of our site.
