So far I believe that Javascript is awesome! I find this language more similar to Java with most of the syntax calls that I used back ICS 111 and 211. These syntax like while, for, and if-statements for a quick example. I technically learned a little bit of JavaScript with my web development class (ICS 215). To me, I think Javascript is a great language for software engineers
