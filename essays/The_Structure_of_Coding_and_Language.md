I believe using ESLint with Intellij IDEA is an awesome experience. Intellij, if you do not happen to know, is a Java IDE (integrated development environment) usually used by software developers. When using Intellij, I find that the green checkmarks are extremely useful while programming. The green checkmark lets me know that I am on the right track and being syntactically correct with my current project I am working on. Even though it may seem like a nuisance while trying to fix code in a timely matter, it provides helpful and suggestive tips on improving the quality of the code. For example, say you were to go into tutoring for help on a math problem and the tutor just told you that your work is all wrong but didn’t tell you what to fix.  For most people, this wouldn’t be helpful because the tutor did not provide you with step-by-step guidance on what to fix instead they just focused on what was wrong.

Once one gets accustomed to the coding style ESLint, more information <script src="https://eslint.org/docs/about/" target="_blank">here </script>, it becomes increasingly easier to follow the structure of the coding standard. Having a coding standard, it helps software developers get in the groove of coding and produce lines of code quickly in a time-efficient matter. This is comparative to the grammar rules that one follows when learning a language. For myself, I could compare it to when I first started to learn the Japanese language. First, I learned the basics of verbs, adverbs, nouns, and subject-particles, etc. Then we put everything together in one concise sentence, which eventually leads to formal and non-formal conversations. Later on, I found similarities between the English language and the Japanese language through styles of conversation. 

Overall, learning the ropes with ESLint with Intellij IDEA is just like earning a new language. In the beginning, it may seem overwhelming to have to learn so much in one week with a new IDE. However, once finding similarities between what we know previously with other developer tools we might have used in the past and carry it over to new concepts then it becomes relatively easy.
